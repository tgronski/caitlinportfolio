    articlePart1:(<p>It was during a walk home with friends one day after catching Greta Gerwig’s adaption of Little Women that I stumbled upon a plain, but unsettling truth: I had no hobbies. After a passionate debate over whether Timothée Chalamet was the best casting choice for the story’s character Laurie, our conversation turned to the distinct talents of each sister in the film: Jo writes novels, Amy paints, Beth plays piano, and Meg acts. It’s not lost on me that they dream about pursuing these talents professionally, but are stifled by nineteenth century gender norms – only Jo is able to successfully turn her talent into a career. But putting aside my usual feminist agenda for a moment, my mind was fixated on something else. The period film elicits visions of a quainter time, where it was commonplace to take up leisurely crafts and master them over time through careful practice and dedication.<br/><br/> While I love my career and can’t imagine ever giving it up, I’m part of a generation unmistakably rooted in hustle culture – one in which culture is often nowhere to be found. Sweeping oil landscapes and grand musical numbers can hardly be defined as the stuff of millennial pastimes. Our self-worth is measured through LinkedIn connections and carefully-constructed job titles (think ‘Brand Evangelist’ or ‘Talent & Vibe Manager’) plastered in our Instagram bios. We’re frighteningly comforted by push notifications and we’re constantly refreshing our social feeds for a jolt of gratification that never lasts long. We fail to understand why we don’t feel happy or fulfilled after a twelve-hour working day, punctuated by trivial tweets and texts. We don’t stop to consider taking up a hobby or a leisure activity – in fact, we don’t stop to consider much at all.<br/><br/> Endless <a className="BlueLink" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2863117/" target="_blank">studies</a> have proven that hobbies help reduce stress and spark creativity, but they also protect your sense of self-worth when you’re criticized at work or face a difficult situation with a co-worker. In other words, your bad day at the office doesn’t follow you home. It’s easy to skip that bottle of wine and pity party with your coworkers when you have a blanket to crochet or a loaf of bread to bake. With millennials’ healthy penchant for self-improvement, it begs the question: why isn’t my generation picking up hobbies? Of course, critics have long pointed to the digital era and the instant gratification that comes with it. And while I generally agree with their assessment, it fails to address why we tend to our TV screens and phones like a pet or houseplant that requires our unrequited love attention.</p>),

    articlePart2: (<p>More often that not, engaging with technology is a passive activity. I’m embarrassed to admit how many times I’ve polished off 5 episodes of a show without being able to remember what happened. We turn to binge-watching and TikTok not because we’re lazy, but because shallow entertainment promises a subconscious respite from our to-do lists and reminder alerts and the weight of being left alone with our thoughts. It’s easy to avoid feeling guilty over wasted time when our screens seem to freeze time itself, offering a hazy purgatory where the pressure to commodify our time fades away with the click of button – if only for a little while.<br/><br/> Hobbies, on the other hand, require a conscious decision to set aside time and commit to a specific activity, without the promise of a tangible or lucrative outcome. Even the preliminary steps of taking a hobby are enough to deter one from seeing it through – whether it’s setting aside thirty minutes to browse your local crafts store or investing in a good pair of hiking boots. Nothing scares a millennial quite like wasted time or monetary commitment. <br/><br/>This sentiment has never been more apparent to me since moving to New York City, where it seems to be a faux pas to ask someone what they like to do outside of work. Instead, we swap stories of late nights spend at the office and even feel a sense of fleeting sense of satisfaction when our overtime hours outnumber those of our friends. And for those of us who have a hobby, it’s synonymous with a side hustle that helps pay off our student loans or give us a leg up in our career. <br/><br/>But after watching Little Women, I couldn’t stop thinking about hobbies in their purest form – an activity you perform simply because it brings you joy. I decided to pick up my guitar that had been collecting dust ever since I graduated high school and almost immediately found myself hooked. Four weeks and many YouTube guitar demos later, I learned to play a rendition of Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams that doesn’t totally hurt my (or my roommate’s) ears. And as I began to play the chords louder and clearer, I found an unexpected sound hidden in the music – silence, a break from that near-constant voice in the back of my head urging me to be productive and maximize every second of my free time. <br/><br/>In my experience, the hurdle with hobbies was at the onset. It was shaking off the TikTok hangover, ignoring my push notifications, and most importantly giving myself permission to do something that I couldn’t necessarily sell, add to my resume, or show off on Instagram. I’m not saying that I’m deleting Netflix or pulling a Gaugin and going off the grid to become a worldly painter. But having a hobby to turn to gave me a renewed sense of purpose and fulfillment. I’ve managed to crawl out under the heavy shadows of corporate walls and blue light addiction – and I owe it all to some nineteenth century little women.</p>)},

    articlePart1:(<p>If you asked me a month ago what my workout routine looked like, you’d be met with an abrupt change of the conversation. Sure, I hit up a boxing studio a few times a month and went for runs along the Hudson River when I was feeling particularly moody, but I’m well-aware this can hardly be called a routine. I would work out when I felt like it, and take another ‘rest day’ when I didn’t. <br/><br/>

        Whenever I was faced with those forms at the doctors’ office asking to mark how many times a week you exercise, I always find myself cursing my capricious Gemini nature. If only I’d been born in December, I could have been one of those type A regulars who proudly sits front row in every workout class and has inside jokes with every instructor; astrology always comes in handy when you want to dodge accountability for your own for shortcomings. <br/><br/>
        
        Yet when it came to coming up with excuses not to stick with a workout routine, that’s where I brought my A-game. I’ve talked myself into not returning to workout studios simply because an instructor smiled too much in a 7AM class or dared to make direct eye contact with me during a round of burpees – I’ve always been a firm believer that subway rules can and should be applied during any form of public physical activity. <br/><br/>
        
        But after awhile, I made the painstaking realization that empty excuses don’t get you very far. I was desperate for a glow-up, but I needed someone to show me the light. And Kayla Itsines was just the person to do it, in all her sweaty, abs-flat-as-a-cutting-board glory.</p>),
        articlePart2:(<p><b>How It Works </b>

            Kayla Itsines’ SWEAT app includes a range of 11 programs, including BBG Beginner, BBG Stronger, LIFTING at home, and more – no great mystery here on which program I’d select. <br/><br/>
            
            BBG Beginner begins with low impact exercises, designed to gradually adjust your body to build fundamental fitness and strength over the course of 8 weeks. It starts out with two workouts and increases to three workouts in later weeks. Each week includes: 
            <ul>
            
            <li>2-3 x Resistance training sessions</li>
            
            <li>2 x Cardio sessions (3 x Cardio sessions in Weeks 7 and 8)</li>
            
            <li>2 x Recovery sessions (including 1 x Rest day)</li>
            </ul>
            
            The resistance session target a specific body area, including 'Arms & Abs', 'Legs' and 'Full Body' sessions. Each session is 28 minutes long and consist of four seven-minute circuits. The goal is to complete the four exercises in each circuit as many times as you can within seven minutes.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Why It Works</b> 
            <ul>
            <li>Accountability</li>
            </ul>
            
            Since each circuit features a video loop of Kayla demonstrating the exercises, it’s easy to make sure I’m getting the form down right and feels like she’s right there with me. Maybe it’s from a childhood filled with angry coaches who thought screaming expletives was a prerequisite for a winning game, but I’ve never been more motivated by the presence of smiling, but silent instructor. And with each circuit broken down into only 7 minutes and a timer built into the app to hold me accountable, I’m motivated to stick it out and keep moving, no matter how drenched in sweat I may be. 
            <ul>
            {" "}<li>Gratification  </li>
            </ul>
             After completing each circuit, the app makes a satisfying ‘ding!’ sound, firing off a dopamine release not unlike the moment my direct deposit hits my bank account or a friend texts me to cancel plans on a Friday night. It’s the small things in life. 
            <ul>
            <li>User-Friendliness </li>
            </ul>
               With a comprehensive workout program tucked neatly into an app on my phone, I can sneak in a solid workout anywhere, anytime – without wasting a minute trying to figure out what kind of workout to do or how to do it. Long gone are the days of trying to attempt a donkey kick or a spider plank with the grace of a teenager at a school dance. I never thought I’d say this in my lifetime, but I think I’m one of those people are the gym that actually looks like they know what they’re doing. <br/><br/>
            
            At $120 year (or $20 a month), Kayla’s SWEAT app is well-worth the investment for a (former) workout commitment-phobe like myself. I can finally face those forms at the doctor’s office with confidence and check off the ‘3-4 times a week’ box – take that, Type As of the world!</p>)
